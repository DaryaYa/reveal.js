1.Slide 1 (Canvas).
	Canvas is one of the most well-known feature in HTML5. 
Developers like to use it for creating rich web applications. 
The Canvas API provides a means for drawing 
graphics via JavaScript and the HTML <canvas> element. 
Among other things, it can be used for animation, 
game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.

2.Slide 2 ( X and Y).
	Every canvas element has x and y coordinates. X being the horizontal coordinate and Y being 
the vertical coordinate. The following image shows these coordinates on a canvas.

3.Slide 3 (Setting up the canvas).
	To set up a canvas for drawing, your must add a <canvas> tag in HTML and assign a 2D drawing 
context to it in JavaScript. All the drawing operations are performed in the context.
The actual drawing is done using the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface.
